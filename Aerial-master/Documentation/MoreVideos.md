##### Note 

Check out [the instructions here](https://github.com/glouel/AerialCommunity/blob/master/CreatingASource.md) on how to create your own video sources. And drop us a line if you want to be featured here!

# Local sources

Aerial can also play videos that are on your machine. Rule of thumb is, if QuickTime can play it, Aerial can. There are a few complexities surrounding Catalina and Big Sur, because of sandboxing changes and security improvements in macOS. As a result, you cannot add videos from the "likely" location you'd want to use (Downloads, Desktop, Documents) and it's highly recommended to use a "safe location" like `/Users/Shared/`. Local sources are not supported in the current 2.0.0 build but will be back soon. In the meantime, check [those instructions, for use in version 1.9.2](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Documentation/CustomVideos.md).
